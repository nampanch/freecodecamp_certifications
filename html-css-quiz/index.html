    <!--
      Step 4:Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition along with viewport.
      The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
      Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.

    <!-- Step 6:Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page.
      This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.Add a header and a main element to your page.The header element will be
      used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.The main element will contain the core content of your
      page.
    -->
    <header>
      <!--
        Step 7:Within the header, provide context about the page by nesting one img, h1, and nav element.
        The img should point to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg, and have an id of logo.
        The h1 should contain the text HTML/CSS Quiz.

       -->
       <img  id="logo" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg">
      <h1>HTML/CSS Quiz</h1>
      <!-- Step 12:To enable navigation on the page, add an unordered list with the following three list items:
              INFO
              HTML
              CSS
              The list items text should be wrapped in anchor tags.
      -->
      <nav>
        <!--
          Step 18:To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element an href corresponding to the id of the h2
          elements.

          Step 68:
Finally, the navigation accessibility can be improved by providing keyboard shortcuts.

The accesskey attribute accepts a space-separated list of access keys. For example:

<button type="submit" accesskey="s">Submit</button>
Give each of the navigation links a single-letter access key.

Note: It is not always advised to use access keys, but they can be useful

Well done. You have completed the Accessibility Quiz practice project.

      Step 14:As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers. You can semantically separate the content
      within the form using section elements.Within the main element, create a form with three nested section elements.
       Then, make the form submit to https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz, using the correct method.

    <main>

        Step 14:As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers. You can semantically separate the content
        within the form using section elements.Within the main element, create a form with three nested section elements.
        Then, make the form submit to https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz, using the correct method.

        Step 15:To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element
         on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI),
         and accepts preset values.Give each of the section elements the region role.

        Step 16:Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region.
        One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the
        aria-labelledby attribute.Add the following aria-labelledby attributes to the section elements:
        student-info
        html-questions
        css-questions
        Then, within each section element, nest one h2 element with an id matching the corresponding aria-labelledby attribute.
        Give each h2 suitable text content.


       -->
       <form method="post" action="https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz">
        <!--
          Step 20:It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology
           users with a visual reference to the input.This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id
           of the input.This section will take a student's name, email address, and date of birth. Give the label
           elements appropriate for attributes, as well as text content. Then, link the input elements to the corresponding
            label elements. -->
        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="student-info">
          <h2 id="student-info">Student Info</h2>
          <!--
            Step 19:Filling out the content of the quiz, below #student-info, add three div elements with a class of info.
            Then, within each div nest one label element, and one input element.
           Step 21:Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and
            name attribute. Then, give the first input a placeholder attribute.
           Step 22:Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson,
           this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an
           actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.Remove the placeholder text from the first
            input element, relying on the label being the best-practice.
           -->
           <div class="info">
            <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
            <input id="student-name" tupe="text" name="student-name" placeholder="e.g. Quincy Larson"/>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label for="student-email">Email:</label>
            <input id="student-email" type="email" name="student-email" />
          </div>
          <!--
            Step 23:Arguably, D.O.B. is not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users.
            One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the label, is to add text only a
            screen reader can read.Append a span element with a class of sr-only to the current text content of the third
            label element.
            Step 24:Within the span element, add the text (Date of Birth).
           -->
          <div class="info">
            <label for="birth-date">D.O.B.<span class="sr-only">(Date of Birth)</span></label>
            <input id="birth-date" type="date" name="birth-date"/>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!--
          Step 26:Within the second section element, add two div elements with a class of question-block.
          Then, within each div.question-block element, add one p element with text of incrementing numbers,
          starting at 1, and one fieldset element with a class of question.
          Step 27:Each fieldset will contain a true/false question.Within each fieldset, nest one legend element,
          and one ul element with two options.
          Step 28:Give each fieldset an adequate name attribute. Then, give both unordered lists a class of answers-list.
          Finally, use the legend to caption the content of the fieldset by placing a true/false question as the text content.

        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="html-questions">
          <h2 id="html-questions">HTML Questions</h2>

                of its parent fieldset element
              </legend>
               <!--
                Step 29:To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow
                both to be selected at the same time.Within each list element, nest one label element, and within each label
                 element, nest one input element with the appropriate type.
                Step 30:Add an id to all of your radio inputs so you can link your labels to them.
                Give the first one an id of q1-a1. Give the rest of them ids of q1-a2, q2-a1, and q2-a2, respectively.
                Step 32:Give the label elements text such that the input comes before the text. Then, give the input elements
                 a value matching the text.The text should either be True or False.
                Step 33:If you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be
                selected at the same time.Group the relevant inputs together such that only one input from a pair can be
                selected at a time.
